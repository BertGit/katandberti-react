                The setting for our wedding will be at this venue, which is based right next to the town of Lalinde, the heart of town only 10 minute walk away.
                Though we’d love to have you all here, there is only accomodation on site for the wedding party, and if we haven’t already, we will get in touch with you to offer you accomodation here first.

            <h2>Accommodation</h2>
            <p>
                This is a very popular destination for tourists so there are plenty of places to stay, but they are booking up fast due to the half-term week so we suggest reserving somewhere as soon as possible.

                <strong>Lalinde</strong> - the location town of our venue, and where many of the wedding party will be staying.
