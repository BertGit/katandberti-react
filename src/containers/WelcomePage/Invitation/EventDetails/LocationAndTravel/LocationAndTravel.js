            <h2>Where is it?</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Dordogne region, South West France</em>
                We have chosen to have our wedding in the beautiful region of the Dordogne river. It is a rural part of the French countryside that is popular with holiday makers due to the good food, activities and historic sites.

            </p>
            <p>
                <em>The town of Lalinde</em>
                Our lovely venue is in the town of Lalinde, which is situated west of Bergerac. This is approximately 2 hours west of Bordeaux, the South West coast. The town is a quaint french market town by the river, and conveniently located near the local attractions, as well as Bergerac airport.
            </p>

            <h2>How do I get there?</h2>
            <p>
                <em>By air</em>
                Flights to Bergerac are the most ideal, as this is only a 20 minute drive away. If Bergerac isnâ€™t possible, then Bordeaux is the next closest airport, this is approx 2 hours drive. Book early to avoid higher costs next year!
                We advise to add insurance and flexi fare to your flight as there are sometimes strikes at airports this time of year.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>By car/ferry</em>
                For those travelling from the UK, the other option would be to drive down, using the ferry or Euro tunnel for the channel crossing. Again, consider booking early.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>By train</em>
                Eurostar is possible, but might involve a few changes, and can be expensive.
            </p>

            <h2>Do I need a car?</h2>
            <p>
                If you fly into Bergerac, you can get to the town or accomodation nearby easily by taxi, but having a car will make it easier to do more things in the area during your whole stay. If you fly to Bordeaux then we do recommend hiring a car.
